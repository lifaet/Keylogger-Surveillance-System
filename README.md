# ABSTRACT 
The Keylogger Surveillance System is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and 
record each keystroke and DNS query made by a system on a specific computer. It has the 
capability to upload real-time data to an FTP server and provides a secure local and online web 
console as an interface for viewing and analyzing log files. Keyloggers are computer programs 
that record every keystroke made by a computer user, often to gain fraudulent access to passwords 
and other confidential information. On the other hand, a DNS query logger is a tool that records 
the DNS requests and responses sent and received by the system or user. It can help troubleshoot 
DNS issues, monitor DNS activity, and analyze DNS traffic patterns. The Keylogger Surveillance 
System combines both keyloggers and DNS loggers. These tools are often used as spyware by 
cybercriminals to steal personally identifiable information (PII), login credentials, and sensitive 
enterprise data. However, there are ethical uses for this application, such as employers observing 
employees' computer activities, parents supervising their children's internet usage, device owners 
tracking unauthorized activity on their devices, and law enforcement agencies analyzing incidents 
involving computer use. 
While this tool has the potential for misuse, it also has numerous ethical applications. I strongly 
advocate for its use solely for ethical purposes. Any unethical use of this application is strictly 
prohibited and strongly discouraged.
